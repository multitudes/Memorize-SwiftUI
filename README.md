# Memorize-SwiftUI

My first SwiftUI course with Paul Hegarty at Stanford [(youtube link)](https://youtu.be/jbtqIBpUG7g).

I really love his teaching style and in the first two lessons I already gained insights in what is the deel underlying difference to UIKit and starting to falling in love with SwiftUI

I organized the different stages of the course in different commits so I can come back and practice some coding, without to recode the whole project.

He said in the introduction that students have to be able to code the first two weeks from scratch before to start the assignments. I believe this is a good idea. Coding is a practice task! This is why I organized it into commits. I can start where I want, practice and then reset to the last commit without changing anything.
