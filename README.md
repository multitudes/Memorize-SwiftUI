# Memorize-SwiftUI

My first SwiftUI course with Paul Hegarty at Stanford [(youtube link)](https://youtu.be/jbtqIBpUG7g).

I really love his teaching style and in the first two lessons I already gained insights in what is the deel underlying difference to UIKit and starting to falling in love with SwiftUI
